# Wind-project
From 2D strokes to a 3D fluid representation

The code cosists of two parts in directories `sketching_dynamic_fluids` and `optimisation`. The first one is GUI where user can draw a curve, build velocities/accelerations from it by clicking "T" and print the results to a file by clicking "P". The second is the computing part that builds flow according to the curve, changing in time, using data from the file received by the first program.

One can find the example results in the directory `examples`.
